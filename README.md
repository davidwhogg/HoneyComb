## Projects

* Stellar asteroseismology or parameter estimation without explicit line identification or peak identification in the periodogram.
* Replacement of the FFT or periodogram with a model that generates the data, including heterogenous, finite integration times on a heterogeneous grid, and heteroskedastic noise.
* Measurement of stellar oscillations at frequencies well above the classic "Nyquist" limit.

## Philosophy

In many data-analysis problems in the physical sciences,
the observations are (effectively) noisy projections of the world.
"The world" is itself a large set of continuous functions (fields)
of space, time, momentum, and so on.
The world has an essentially infinite number of degrees of freedom,
but the things we *need* to know about it are in many cases quite limited.
Good data analysis will infer what we need to infer
but avoid estimating all the details of the the continuous fields.
