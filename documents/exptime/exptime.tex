\begin{abstract}
Most astronomical surveys with time-domain astrophysics goals are
aiming to take data as uniformly as possible.
Here we show that as a survey varies its exposure times (from exposure
to exposure), it becomes much more sensitive to stellar variability at
periods shorter than the mean exposure time and shorter than the mean
time between exposures.
When thinking about such short periods, it is improper to think of the
data as ``sampling'' the stellar light curve; the data must be modeled
accurately as being generated by averages or integrations of the light
curve over the individual-exposure exposure times.
We show that---unlike in a survey with uniform exposure times---the
sensitivity to short-period variability of the data in a
variable-exposure-time survey is a very smooth function of period,
degrading monotonically towards the very short-period limit.
Sensitivity to long-period variability is unharmed by randomizing the
exposure times.
Near-future imaging surveys (such as \TESS\ and \LSST) can capitalize
on these results at no cost in total survey duration, data volume, or
bandwidth simply by randomizing exposure times (within a well-defined
interval).
Costs and benefits are discussed critically.

\section{Introduction}

Motivated by the \LSST\ straw plan.

No ground-based survey can be homoskedastic, so why go with constant exposure time?

Salutory effects on point-spread function, calibration, dynamic range, non-linearities.

Costs of tracking (in the system and in data analysis) the exposure times used.

Here we consider the asteroseismological angle.
